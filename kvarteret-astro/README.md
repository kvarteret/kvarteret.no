# Kvarteret Astro proof of concept

## Quickstart:

1. `cd` into the `kvarteret-astro` folder
2. Add a `.env.local` file in this folder with the following content (use the tokens from the .env.local file in the old kvarteret project. Keep in mind DIRECTUS_STATIC_TOKEN has been renamed from CMS_TOKEN):

```
PUBLIC_DIRECTUS_URL=https://cms.kvarteret.no
DIRECTUS_STATIC_TOKEN=<token>
CRESCAT_TOKEN=<token>
STUDENTBERGEN_TOKEN=<token>
```

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Open your browser and go to `localhost:4321` to see the site

## Features:

- [ ] Fetches events from Student Bergen
- [x] Fetches events from Directus CMS
- [ ] Support english language
- [ ] Renders all pages from Directus CMS

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Astro components>
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
